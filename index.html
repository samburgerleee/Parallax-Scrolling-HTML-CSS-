			<p class = 'fuji'>I remember that one instance when I had my Chinese dictation in school, my teacher asked me to write Mount Fuji in Chinese. The actual words were "富士山". However, I had no idea what that was and I ended up writing it as "父士山". This is one of the darkest memories I had as my dad has been laughing at my poor chinese even till now. I mean... who knows in a decade's time, I actually went on tothe summit via a 14-hour night hike from 8pm to 2pm. This whole place was so breathtaking and I wished that I could have spent a night there to appreciate the beauty of the scenery!</p>

				<p>If you are a student, always remember to bring along your student card to get special discounts for all the amazing music concerts in Japan! I was really.. REALLY fortunate that there was a concert performed by Kyushu Symphony Orchestra. No 3-hour Nutcracker ballet but as an experienced performer for these opera, I can't say no to this golden opportunity to watch the concert.  </p>

				<p>  If you want to experience the marvellous night scenery of Tokyo but you do not want spend too much going up to the Tokyo tower, Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building is the complimentary option. Remember I told you that I was a college student travelling to Japan?
